# Entropy-Driven Composition
## Inspired by Laurie Spiegel's Work on Information Theory and Music

> "The moment to moment variation of level of predictability that is embodied in an entropy curve arouses in the listener feelings of expectation, anticipation, satisfaction, disappointment, surprise, tension, frustration and other emotions."

## Core Philosophy

This project uses **informational entropy** as a compositional parameter, directly inspired by Laurie Spiegel's pioneering work on using information theory principles in algorithmic music composition.

Instead of making musical decisions based solely on discrete events (captures, blunders), the system continuously responds to the **underlying complexity** of chess positions. This creates music that:

- **Anticipates** critical moments before they happen
- **Breathes** with the natural ebb and flow of position complexity
- **Evolves organically** rather than switching between discrete states
- **Reflects uncertainty** when positions are unclear

---

## What is Entropy in This Context?

**Entropy measures positional uncertainty** - how difficult it is to evaluate a position:

| Position State | Entropy | Musical Character |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Opening theory** | Very Low (0.0-0.2) | Simple, predictable, calm |
| **Quiet maneuvering** | Low (0.2-0.4) | Gentle variation, stable |
| **Complex middlegame** | Medium (0.4-0.7) | Active, developing tension |
| **Tactical complications** | High (0.7-0.9) | Chromatic, irregular, dense |
| **Unclear sacrifice** | Very High (0.9-1.0) | Chaotic, unpredictable |

The entropy **curve over time** becomes a narrative arc that the music follows.

## Sources of Entropy

### 1. Evaluation Volatility (Primary)
**Concept**: Computer evaluations that swing wildly indicate an unclear, complex position.

**Musical Mapping**: Position uncertainty → musical unpredictability
- Stable eval: Simple harmonies, regular rhythm
- Volatile eval: Chromatic notes, irregular timing

**Why This Works**: Evaluation volatility directly measures "computational difficulty" - a form of informational entropy.

---

### 2. Tactical Density (Secondary)
**Concept**: Positions with many captures, checks, and threats have higher complexity.

**Musical Mapping**: Tactical richness → timbral richness
- Few tactics: Sparse texture, clean tones
- Many tactics: Dense harmonies, complex filtering

**Why This Works**: More tactical options = more branching possibilities = higher entropy.

---

### 3. Thinking Time (Tertiary, Optional)
**Concept**: When a player thinks for a long time, the position is difficult.

**Musical Mapping**: Decision difficulty → musical complexity
- Quick moves: Obvious patterns, predictable
- Long thinks: Complex patterns, searching

**Why This Works**: Human thinking time is a psychological measure of positional complexity.

## Musical Parameters Controlled by Entropy

### Harmonic Complexity
**Low Entropy**: Root and fifth only (stable, predictable)
**High Entropy**: Full chromatic scale (tense, unpredictable)

The available note pool expands/contracts with position complexity, creating a direct mapping between chess uncertainty and musical uncertainty.

---

### Rhythmic Regularity
**Low Entropy**: Metronomic, steady timing
**High Entropy**: Irregular, unpredictable durations

Rhythm becomes less predictable as positions become more complex, mirroring the difficulty of finding clear moves.

---

### Spectral Evolution (Filter Movement)
**Low Entropy**: Slow, steady filter sweeps
**High Entropy**: Fast, restless filter changes

The timbral character becomes more active and searching as positions become harder to evaluate.

---

### Articulation (Portamento/Glide)
**Low Entropy**: Smooth, connected glides between notes
**High Entropy**: Jumpy, disconnected articulation

The connection between musical events mirrors the clarity of chess moves.

---

### Polyphonic Density
**Low Entropy**: Single voice or simple dyads
**High Entropy**: Multiple voices, cluster harmonies

More complex positions spawn more simultaneous musical voices, creating textural richness.

---

## Continuous vs. Discrete

### Traditional Event-Driven Approach
Musical changes occur **only at discrete events**:
```
[quiet pattern] → BLUNDER! → [crisis pattern] → [quiet pattern]
```

**Problem**: Misses the gradual build-up before critical moments.

---

### Entropy-Driven Approach
Music **continuously evolves** with position complexity:
```
simple → building tension → peak complexity → resolution → simple
```

**Benefit**: The music anticipates and reflects the natural narrative arc of the position.

## Integration Across Layers

### Layer 1 (Drone)
Entropy doesn't directly affect Layer 1 - it's determined by overall game narrative.

### Layer 2 (Patterns)
**Pattern generators** use entropy to:
- Select note pools (diatonic vs. chromatic)
- Adjust rhythm variations
- Control pattern density
- Modulate filter cutoffs

### Layer 3a (Heartbeat)
**Pulse rate** responds to entropy:
- Low entropy: Slow, steady heartbeat (60 BPM)
- High entropy: Fast, anxious heartbeat (100 BPM)

### Layer 3b (Gestures)
**Gesture characteristics** scale with entropy:
- Impact intensity
- Bloom complexity
- Particle emission density
- Spectral richness

## The Spiegel Connection

Laurie Spiegel's work emphasized:

1. **Information theory as compositional tool**: Using mathematical measures of complexity to drive musical decisions
2. **Continuous evolution**: Music that develops organically rather than switching between states
3. **Predictability control**: Varying the listener's ability to anticipate what comes next
4. **Emotional mapping**: Connecting information-theoretic measures to emotional responses

This project applies these principles by:
- Using chess evaluation volatility as an entropy measure
- Creating continuous musical evolution through entropy curves
- Controlling predictability via note selection and rhythm
- Mapping positional uncertainty to musical tension

## Example: Fischer vs. Taimanov, Game 4 (1971)

### Opening (Plies 1-20)
**Entropy**: 0.08 → 0.27 → 0.08
**Musical Result**: Simple theory moves → exchange complications → settled position
**Sound**: Calm → briefly active → calm

### Early Middlegame (Plies 21-28)
**Entropy**: Gradually rises 0.12 → 0.35
**Musical Result**: Building tension, expanding harmonies
**Sound**: Slowly developing complexity

### Critical Phase (Plies 29-45)
**Entropy**: 0.35 → 0.58 → 0.73
**Musical Result**: King hunt tactics, chromatic notes, irregular rhythm
**Sound**: Peak tension, chaotic

### Endgame Conversion (Plies 46-141)
**Entropy**: Gradually falls 0.73 → 0.20
**Musical Result**: Resolving harmonies, simplifying texture
**Sound**: Tension release, clarity returning

The music **tells the story** of the game through entropy, not just through discrete events.

## Design Principles

### 1. Smoothing
Raw entropy is smoothed to avoid sudden jumps that would sound unmusical.

### 2. Context-Aware Weighting
Different entropy sources have different weights:
- Eval volatility: 50% (most direct measure)
- Tactical density: 40% (structural complexity)
- Thinking time: 10% (psychological measure)

### 3. Musical Thresholds
Entropy ranges map to musical character:
- **0.0-0.3**: Simple (root-fifth, regular rhythm)
- **0.3-0.7**: Moderate (diatonic, slight variation)
- **0.7-1.0**: Complex (chromatic, irregular)

### 4. Non-Invasive Integration
Entropy **modulates** existing musical systems rather than replacing them. Pattern generators, gesture archetypes, and heartbeat all respond to entropy while maintaining their core identities.

✓ **Anticipatory music**: Tension builds **before** critical moments occur
✓ **Organic evolution**: Music breathes with position complexity
✓ **Narrative coherence**: The entropy curve creates a through-line
✓ **Emotional mapping**: Positional uncertainty = musical tension
✓ **Non-repetitive**: Same pattern sounds different based on context
✓ **Spiegel-inspired**: Grounded in established algorithmic composition theory
