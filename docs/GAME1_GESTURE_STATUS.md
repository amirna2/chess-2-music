## Moment Types Used in Game1

All moment types in this game are **PARTICLE-BASED** âœ“

| Moment Type | Count | Sections | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **INACCURACY** | 7 | All | Particle: gusts | âœ“ WORKING |
| **TACTICAL_SEQUENCE** | 2 | Middlegame, Endgame | Particle: rhythmic_clusters | âœ“ WORKING |
| **FIRST_EXCHANGE** | 1 | Opening | Particle: impact_burst | âœ“ WORKING |
| **SIGNIFICANT_SHIFT** | 1 | Endgame | Particle: drift_scatter | âœ“ WORKING |
| **FINAL_RESOLUTION** | 1 | Outro | Particle: dissolve | âœ“ WORKING |

**Total Moments**: 12

## Audio Quality Metrics

```
Pre-normalization peak: -18.9 dBFS
Normalization gain: 15.9 dB
Final peak: -3.0 dBFS (target: -3.0 dBFS)
Final RMS: -22.5 dBFS
Crest factor: 19.5 dB
Clipped samples: 0 (0.0000%)
```

âœ“ **Clean output, no clipping**

## What's Working

### Particle System
All particle-based gestures used in Game1 are fully implemented:
- âœ“ `gusts` emission (INACCURACY)
- âœ“ `rhythmic_clusters` emission (TACTICAL_SEQUENCE)
- âœ“ `impact_burst` emission (FIRST_EXCHANGE)
- âœ“ `drift_scatter` emission (SIGNIFICANT_SHIFT)
- âœ“ `dissolve` emission (FINAL_RESOLUTION)

### Synthesis Pipeline
- âœ“ Layer 1: Drone (DEATH_SPIRAL narrative)
- âœ“ Layer 2: Pattern generation (POSITIONAL_THEORY, DESPERATE_DEFENSE, KING_HUNT)
- âœ“ Layer 3a: Heartbeat (70 BPM)
- âœ“ Layer 3b: Particle gestures
- âœ“ Intelligent spacing algorithm
- âœ“ Entropy-driven panning
- âœ“ Master bus normalization

## What's NOT Needed for Game1

### Curve-Based Gestures
Game1 doesn't use any curve-based gestures, so the 59 missing curve-based types are **not relevant** for this game.

**Curve-based archetypes NOT used**:
- MOVE, GAME_CHANGING, CRITICAL_SWING
- MATE_SEQUENCE, KING_ATTACK, TIME_PRESSURE
- BLUNDER, BRILLIANT, CHECKMATE, MISTAKE, STRONG
- CASTLING, PROMOTION, QUEENS_TRADED, etc.

---

## Next Steps for Game1

### Current Focus
Game1 is **fully functional** - all gestures synthesize successfully!

### Potential Improvements
1. **Listen to output** - Does it sound good?
2. **Tune particle parameters** - Adjust density, lifetime, pitch ranges
3. **Adjust gesture spacing** - Currently using intelligent spacing
4. **Fine-tune entropy influence** - How much should entropy affect gestures?

### Section-by-Section Refinement
Work through each section listening for:
- Are gestures too loud/quiet?
- Do they fit the narrative?
- Is the spacing natural?
- Does entropy scaling work well?

## Comparison with Other Games

**Game1 is a GOOD starting point because**:
- Only uses particle-based gestures
- All 5 particle types work
- Relatively simple game (84 plies)
- Clear narrative arc (DEATH_SPIRAL)

**For other games**, we may need:
- Curve-based gestures (BLUNDER, BRILLIANT, CHECKMATE)
- More complex archetypes
- Different particle emission types

---

## Implementation Status Summary

âœ… **Game1: 100% Complete**
- All moment types implemented
- All gestures synthesize
- Clean audio output
- Ready for refinement

ðŸ”´ **Other Games: Unknown**
- Need to check what moment types they use
- May require curve-based implementations
- Work game-by-game as planned
